# `dhello`

See `src/hello_backend` and `src/hello_frontend`.
Contains a single canister callable function called `greet`.

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd bc-ic-dhello/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Set rust backtrace to get more useful debug info when things go wrong
export RUST_BACKTRACE=full

# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --clean --background

# Deploys the canisters to the replica and generates the candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor

### Deploy canisters individually

* Create canister on the IC network: `dfx canister --network ic create hello_backend --with-cycles 1000000000000`
* Build WebAssembly module: `dfx build --network ic hello_backend`
* Install WebAssembly module inside the canister: `dfx canister --network ic install hello_backend` 
* Call canister method: `dfx canister --network ic call hello_backend greet '(" world")'`

## Useful commands

* Check on-chain balance: `dfx wallet --network=ic balance`
* Get principal ID: `dfx identity get-principal`
* Get ledger ID: `dfx ledger account-id`
* Get on-chain wallet ID: `dfx identity --network=ic get-wallet`
